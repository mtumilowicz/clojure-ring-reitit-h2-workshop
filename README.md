## ring
* is a Clojure web applications library
* higher level frameworks such as Compojure or lib-noir use Ring as a common basis
* without a basic understanding of Ring, you cannot write middleware, and you may find debugging
your application more difficult
* supports synchronous and asynchronous endpoints and middleware
    * we focus here only on synchronous part
* A web application developed for Ring consists of four components:
    * Handler
        * **synchronous** handlers
            ```
            (defn what-is-my-ip [request]
              {:status 200
               :headers {"Content-Type" "text/plain"}
               :body (:remote-addr request)})
            ```
    * Request
        * represented by Clojure maps
        * some standard keys: `:headers`, `:body`, `:content-type`, `:path-params`
    * Response
        * is created by the handler, and contains three keys: `:status`, `:headers`, `:body`
    * Middleware
        * higher-level functions that add additional functionality to handlers
        * first argument of a middleware function should be a handler, and its return value should be a new
        handler function that will call the original handler
        * threading macro (->) can be used to chain middleware together
            ```
            (def app
              (-> handler
                  (wrap-content-type "text/html")
                  (wrap-keyword-params)
                  (wrap-params)))
            ```
        * muuntaja/wrap-formats
            * negotiates a request body based on accept, accept-charset and content-type headers and decodes the body
            with an attached Muuntaja instance into `:body-params`
            * encodes also the response body
        * query params
            * `[app.gateway.middleware :refer [wrap-params]`
            * adds three new keys to the request map:
                * `:query-params` - A map of parameters from the query string
                * `:form-params` - A map of parameters from submitted form data
                * `:params` - A merged map of all parameters
